            <p>Cute and recognizable, but why is Pikachu, a cartoon pop icon from Japan, so familiar around the world?

            <p>Pikachu is just over a foot tall and weighs roughly 13lbs. The animal can use lightning-based skills to take down their enemies in battle. Pikachu is easily recognizable as a yellow mouse-like creature with red spots on each cheek and a lightning shaped tail. The pokemon was developed by the game company GameFreak and designed by Atsuko Nishida and finalized by Ken Sugimori. Pikachu’s name comes from two Japanese onomatopoeias, “pikapika” (bright, sparkling) and “chuuchuu” (sound that mice make).

        <div class="text info">
            <p>So, why is Pikachu so familiar? The pokemon has become a well known icon in Japanese pop culture and used as one of the main mascots for the company Nintendo. The fictional animal has been featured in every Pokemon game which has sold over 245 million copies all over the world since the first game released in 1996. Not only is the character featured in several games, but also is a main character in the Pokemon anime which has over 800 episodes and has been shown in 160 countries. Pikachu may be a popular icon in Japan, but also a recognizable character around the world.
